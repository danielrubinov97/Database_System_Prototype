# Database_System_Prototype
The prototype was designed to be practice for future database projects. Inspired by a quiz I gave to the programming class I teach.

On Sundays I teach programming classes for kids these classes are about understanding and programming in C++ on Linux. After teaching conditional statments and strings I decided to give a quiz for them to do.

The quiz goes as follows:
You are a software engineer at Google. Everyone at Google has a different rate of pay and works a different amount of hours per week. Note that if a person works more than 40 hours per week. That is considered overtime. In overtime, the rate of pay for every overtime hour is increased by 1.5 times.

-Write a program that allows your fellow employees to get their total weekly pay, and yearly pay.

Assume 52 weeks a year - 2 weeks vacation time.

After the quiz was administered I told the class that I will bring back two solutions.
1) Simple solution to this problem.
2) Complex solution, a production ready solution. Goal is to hopefully even add a GUI system.
